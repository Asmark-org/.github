# .github

This repository contains any community health files that can be used as defaults across repositories.

## Usage
This repo is Public and it's workflows and templates will auto apply to all other repos in the org. If you want to override those behaviours in a repo here's how:

1. Manually copy the files you want to use to the `.github` directory in your repository.
2. Customize the files to fit your needs.
3. Once the files are in the `main` branch of your repository, they will be used instead of those found here.
